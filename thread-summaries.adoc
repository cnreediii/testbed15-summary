[[DataCentricSecurity]]

==== `Data Centric Security`

*Explore How Data Centric Security principals can be applied at the feature level in a geospatial data store.*

Data-centric security emphasizes the security of the data itself rather than the security of networks, servers, or applications. In Testbed-15, the focus was on how security works at a Feature Level and what implications this has on the network in terms of additional data burden. With a focus on actual interactions and general workflows, Testbed-15 work sought to answer the question of how data centric security can be applied to OGC standards based architectures:

* How does data centric security work with OGC standards and best practices?
* Which elements are already supported and how?
* Which modifications to existing OGC standards or best practices are necessary to exploit the full potential of data centric security?

To answer these questions, the Testbed particpants examined the use of encrypted containers in combination with geospatial data using the encoding for an http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html[OGC API - Features] and the Web Feature Service (WFS) FeatureCollection structure. Within that context, the particants looked at the use of encrypted container formats such as https://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/PROM/ADatP-4778%20EDA%20V1%20E.pdf[NATO STANAG 4778] "Information on standard Metadata Binding" with metadata as defined in https://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/PROM/ADatP-4774%20EDA%20V1%20E.pdf[NATO STANAG 4774] "Confidentiality Metadata Label Syntax" to permit the sharing of sensitive information between allies.

*Geospatial Policy Enforcement Point (GeoPEP) as a Proxy for STANAG 4778*

In general, the work performed in Testbed 15 demonstrated that with a security proxy and an http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html[OGC API - Features] service, an implementation can satisfy the requirements for a data centric security model. The http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/19-016r1.html[OGC Data Centric Security Engineering Report documents the results of implementing three data centric scenarios. Two of the scenarios verified that there are backward compatible methods for implementing data centric security.

The following are additional information resources regarding the Data Centric Security task.

==== Federated Cloud Analytics

*Research how emerging technologies and architectures featuring distributed cloud environments can be successfully integrated with OGC standards*

The advent of the cloud computing era has fundamentally changed how people and organizations view computing — and more specifically how people and organizations interact with the resources that they care about: data and services. All computing resources, including clouds, exist in some type of administrative domain wherein access management can be done. As long as resources are all in the same administrative domain, managing access is straight-forward. However, with the continued development of our interconnected world, it is becoming increasingly common that data and services desired by a user exist across different administrative domains.

Easily accessing resources distributed across different administrative domains is a challenge. The naive approach is for an individual to maintain n1 different accounts and credentials for n2 different organizations. A more effective approach is federation.

Simply put, a federation enables a set of participating organizations to selectively share data and resources for specific purposes. The goal is to make federated environments as seamless, transparent, and easy to use as a single centralized environment. More precisely, a federation is a security and collaboration context wherein participants can define, agree up on, and enforce joint resource discovery and access policies.

Previous OGC Testbeds addressed a number of issues related to supporting analytic workflows where the data and analytics are hosted or deployed in an ad-hoc manner on multiple heterogeneous clouds that belong to different administrative domains. In this Testbed activity the OGC began to assess the sufficiency of that body of work and identify areas were additional work is needed. This assessment was performed through a proof of concept executing a non-trivial analytic mission leveraging data and analytics hosted on two or more clouds.

Of particular interest in this context are three aspects. Firstly, the handling of security in federations. Second, how the Testbed-13 and Testbed-14 research results of "bringing applications to the data" relate to SCALE and SEED. SCALE is an open source system that provides management and scheduling of automated processing on a cluster of machines. SCALE uses the SEED specification to aid in the discovery and consumption of processes packaged in a Docker containers. Third, the role of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies in the context of handling provenance in federations.

To meet this objective, this task was organized in four separate sub-tasks. The following research questions were addressed by the particpants:

* Federated Security: Can the https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/07/09/nist_cfra_20190709_draft_v1.0.pdf[NIST/IEEE Federated Cloud Architecture] be validated (or invalidated) in a typical federated clouds analytics scenario that includes separate cloud environments? How can the Mediation Server concept developed in Testbed-14 be further enhanced to a fully functional Federation Manager in the sense of NIST/IEEE? What are the advantages and disadvantages, and how does this extended functionality fit within the OGC family of standards?
* Federated Cloud Analytics: How to bring SCALE and SEED into the family of cloud architectures supported by OGC standards? What role does the OGC WPS Standard play? What catalog solutions work best?
* EOC, SCALE, and SEED: How to handle the different approaches for cloud processing? Where are harmonization opportunities, what needs to remain separate?
* Federated Clouds Provenance: How can Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies be used to protect the integrity of different types of provenance data?

The results of each of these work activities are described in the Thread Engineering Reports as well as the additional material below:

=== Thread 2: Cloud Processing and Portrayal (CPP)

[[EOPAD]]

==== Earth Observation Process and Application Discovery

*Researching approaches for users to discover and run the Earth Observation applications they need.*

Over the last decade, several platforms have emerged that provide access to Earth Observation data and processing capacities. These platforms host very large (petabyte) datasets. As such, a paradigm shift from data download and local processing towards application upload and processing close to the physical location of the data is now critical. To interpret peta- or exascale scientific data, capabilities of these platforms need to be combined in future.

Hence, the focus of Testbed-15 work was to define the building blocks through which such applications and related services can be exposed through a Catalogue service. Within that overarching goal, the Testbed particpants described and demonstrated how OGC standards can be used or need to be extended to provide for discovery and use of EO data processing applications that can be deployed and executed by the user or are already deployed and available behind standardized OGC interfaces. The participants also demonstrated how existing and emerging systems - as deployed by NASA (e.g. NASA DAACs and NASA DASS), ESA (ESA TEPs) or systems that have already integrated various nodes such as the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) - can be federated to allow for cross-platform analysis and visualization of data.

The results of this work, documented in the Engineering Report, define the building blocks through which such applications and related services can be exposed through a Catalogue service, including:

* A Data model
* Service interfaces
* A Service management interface

The key findings from the work include:

* The bindings for the proposed Catalogue and GeoJSON Data Model are consistent with existing OGC Standards related to OWS Context and OGC Extensions of OpenSearch.
* Support for facet discovery and faceted search responses was borrowed from existing OASIS SRU specifications and the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/19-020r1.html#SRU-Extension[SRU extension of OpenSearch].
* The proposed Data Model relies on OGC OWS Context [OGC14-055r2] Offerings to describe service or application access mechanisms and endpoints.
* In addition to the GeoJSON-based model, the corresponding JSON-LD representation is proposed as well in this ER. A service or application described in the catalog is modelled as a dcat:DataService in [DCAT-2].

The results of the Data Centric Security task activities as well as supporting information are provided in the following resources:

[[OPF]]

==== Open Portrayal Framework

*Define the Models, APIs, and Architecture to Support and enable Open and Interoperable Portrayal.*

Interoperable, dynamic portrayal of maps and related geospatial data is still challenging when working across multiple computing, rendering, communications and display environments.  Despite previous efforts, the OGC is still missing a robust conceptual model and related APIs capable of supporting multiple style encodings and the style encodings themselves.

Therefore, the primary topics addressed in the OPF Thread covered supporting style sharing and updates, client- and server-side rendering of both vector- and raster data, and converting styles from one encoding to another. This work was based on a draft http://www.opengis.net/doc/PER/t15-D011[conceptual style model]. In addition, there was a requirement to render data according to style definitions in a denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited bandwidth (DDIL) infrastructure.

*Overview of the Testbed-15 Open Portrayal Framework major work items*

The goal of the Testbed-15 Open Portrayal Framework thread was to implement a data discovery, access, and styled rendering scenario. The scenario was based on a simulated humanitarian relief effort in Daraa, Syria area. The simulated scenario requied multiple partners to share information quickly and seamlessly via a Common Operational Picture. To promote this 'common picture', simple maps with styles for day or night operations must be rapidly customized and shared between partnering organizations from many nations. The most recent satellite imagery for the Daraa, Syria, area was also added to the 'common picture', as illustrated below. The scenario also included requirements for data updates performed as a background tasks and support for online/offline functionality.

[[MLD]]

=== Thread 3: Machine Learning and Delta Updates (MLD)

[[MachineLearning]]

==== Machine Learning

*Develop a set of machine learning models and explore their usage within OGC Web service based environments.*

The synergies obtained by integrating machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) with geospatial analysis, also known as GeoAI, is providing ever increasing societal value. Applications such as quickly identifying diseased timber, diffusion of viral infections, or avalanche risk analysis are already providing value and saving lives. However, much work remains to continue to both evolve the geospatial and ML/DL synergy. Issues such as how can training be optimized and what role do standards have need to be answered. A large variety of geospatial data are available through standardized OGC interfaces that could facilitate the discovery and access to datasets used to feed ML tools.

Therefore, the OGC Testbed-15 Machine Learning (ML) task explored the utility of existing OGC Web Services (OWS) to support a large scope of ML tools including EO data processing, image classification, feature extraction and vector attribution. The key research question was how these various ML models can be integrated best within standards-based infrastructures. These infrastructures include OGC Web services that interface any kind of data repository from rather stable image archives to Big data sensor data archives or real time systems.

The research involved implementing five different scenarios. Each scenario focused on a different machine learning challenge and prototype were implemented as an individual demonstrations. The five scenarios were:

* Forest Change Prediction: As a first step towards an automated forest change prediction system, participants developed prototype capability and demonstrated the use of Machine Learning to remove clouds and high altitude cloudets (popcorn clouds) from historical datasets for the http://www.forestresearch.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=272&Itemid=83[Petawawa super site].
* Forest Management Planning: For this scenario, particpants delivered a forest supply management decision maker ML model for the province of New Brunswick forested areas. This included recommending the most efficient optimized path from forest to market -”wood flow model” and recommending new road construction that will be the most efficient over time and safety being considered.
* Lake/River Differentiation: Participants delivered an ML model that delineated lake and river features from an undifferentiated waterbody vector dataset.
* Linked Data Harvesting: The participants developed a semantically driven ML capability to harvest hydrological relations from the web for the Richelieu River / Watershed area. The harvesting process used a variety of data sources.
* Web Service Discovery via Location: The participants delivered a component capable of building an evergreen catalogue of relevant arctic circumpolar Web services. The goal was to develop a ML model that could perform such activities as discover OGC and Esri REST Web services that have some relevance to circumpolar science and evaluate the confidence level of each recommended service using both metadata and data parameters.

[[DeltaUpdates]]

==== Delta Updates

*Explore how changes (updates) to geospatial data can be securely provided to users in the field*

In today's world, geosaptial data is collected and updated at an ever increasing pace. In many application domains, users require these updated data as quickly as possible. First responders, wild fire repsonse teams, war fighters, extreme sports enthusiasts and more all need the latest and best content - including near real time updates.

The key research question in the Delta Updates task was how to implement reliable and secure delta update mechanisms with OGC next generation Web Services such as http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html[OGC API - Features] and the draft https://github.com/opengeospatial/wps-rest-binding[OGC API - Processes]. The research included exploring different mechanisms that either require enhancements to existing OGC API - Features instances or use to be developed OGC API - Processes instances to realize similar functionality without touching existing data access services.

The Delta Updates participants designed and documented a service architecture that allows the delivery of prioritized updates of features to a client, possibly acting in a DDIL (Denied, Degraded, Intermitted or Limited Bandwidth) environment. Two different technical scenarios were investigated and tested:

* The enhancement of Web Feature Service (WFS) instances to support updates on features sets.
* Utilizing a Web Processing Service (WPS) instance to access features, without the need to modify the downstream data service.

image::images/DeltaUpdates.png[image,width=380,height=308]

In the Delta Updates ER, the participants document how prioritized delta updates can be served using a transactional extension to the OGC API – Features and the current WPS standard and draft OGC API – Processes specification in front of operational WFS instances. Both approaches use the same algorithm to keep track of the changes to the dataset.
