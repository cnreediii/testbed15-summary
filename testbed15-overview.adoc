= Testbed 15 Overview

[big red yellow-background]*Research and Rapid Prototyping with the goal of enhancing and extending the OGC Standards Baseline to meet Community requirements.*

In OGCâ€™s annual testbeds, sponsoring organisations specify interoperability requirements to address both their needs as well as gaps in the https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards[OGC Standards Baseline]. OGC staff integrate these requirements into a formal https://www.opengeospatial.org/pressroom/pressreleases/2927[Call for Participation (CFP)]. Technology providers, also known as participants, then receive cost-share support and funding to collaboratively research and rapidly develop prototype solutions. When the testbed is completed, the results are documented in https://www.opengeospatial.org/docs/er[OGC Engineering Reports]. The Engineering Reports may specify change requests to existing OGC standards, extensions to an existing standard, or even a new draft specification. These are submitted to the OGC Standards Program for discussion, consideration, and eventually consensus-based open standards and best practices.

[[Threads]]

== Testbed 15 Key work activities (Threads)

The Testbed is organized in a number of threads. Each thread combines a number of tasks that are further defined in the Call for Participation. The threads integrate both an architectural and a thematic view, which allows keeping related work items close together and removing dependencies across threads. Click on the link if you want to read the detailed description of a Thread as provided in the CFP. In addition, short overviews are provided here.
