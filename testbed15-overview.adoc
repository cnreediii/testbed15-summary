= Innovating Geospatial Data Processing, Analysis, and Visualization

In OGCâ€™s annual major testbed, sponsoring organisations define geospatial IT interoperability and/or technology requirements. OGC staff integrate these requirements into a set of software architectures. The requirements and architectures are documented and released as an OGC CAll for Participation (CFP). Technology providers respond to the CFP and selected organizations receive support and funding to collaboratively research and rapidly develop prototype solutions. Eventually, the results pf the Testbed activity are submitted to the OGC Standards Program to be considered as input into ongoing OGC consensus-based standards and best practices work.

Testbed-15 addressed six main topics (threads) as illustrated in the figure below:

Earth Observation focused on developing a data model and associated catalogue interface to support Earth Observation (EO) application and process discovery. The Data Centric Security task researched the current state of security in protecting data in a geospatial environment using encrypted containers and the encoding for an OGC FeatureCollection structure. The Federated Cloud Analytics thread researched how emerging technologies and architectures featuring distributed cloud environments can be successfully integrated with OGC standards. The Delta Updates thread explored how changes (updates) to geospatial data can be securely provided to users in the field especially in a Denied, Disrupted, Intermittent, and Limited (bandwidth) situation. The Open Portrayal Framework thread investigated OPF requirements and defined models, APIs, and an architecture to support and enable open and interoperable portrayal.The Machine Learning thread used related user scenarios to investigate the integration of ML models and outputs into an OGC Open Web Services (OWS) architecture. 

= Impacts on OGC Standards Work and the Future

The next major OGC Initiative, Testbed-16, runs April to December 2020, with testbed results to be reported as part of the OGC Technical Committee meetings in September and December 2020.

Additionally, Testbed 15 work resulted in:

* All Engineering Reports presented to the Members and approved for https://www.opengeospatial.org/docs/er[public release].
* The various API prototype activities provided detailed input into the https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common[OGC API-Common draft specification] resulting in the release of this document as a draft OGC standard.
* Submission of a formal proposal to form a Styles API Standards Working Group to continue development of the OGC API-Styles with the intent to have that API approved as an official OGC standard.
* Detailed technical and requirements input into the new https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/apirecordsswg[OGC API-Records] (Formerly Catalog) Standards Working Group.
* Proposals for extensions/ehancements to the OGC GeoPackage Standard: Extensions related to tiled feature data, extensions to encode portrayal information (styles and symbols), proposal for Metadata and Application Profiles, and an extension to support semantic annotations.
